## Adoption Pains

Adopting a management system like the Advice Process doesn’t happen overnight even within EE where we have intelligent,  free thinking people there were many bumps in the road.  The main problems we encountered were The Transition of Power, Permission Seeking and dfsda 

### Dealing with Uncertainty 
A side effect of the Advice Process is that power and control is distributed widely throughout the company.  Some people find this transition difficult and struggle with the feeling of not being in control. Passing decisions making onto other team members brings a large amount of uncertainty which many people find uncomfortable, often more so than being wrong.  Its OK, but maybe adopting the Advice Process or working for EE is not the right thing if you feel like this.

### Permission Seeking
The counter side to managers letting go is team members defaulting to the reflex of permission seeking.  If you are the one who is being asked “for permission” then try not to just make a call but rather use this as a teachable opportunity.  Ask questions about the problem, who are experts in the area, who might be affected and help them think about measuring the outcomes and.  Basically, help give them the tools.      

### Drawing the Line
One of the things we still struggle with is when should you run an AP vs. when is it just your day job or size or decision (and execution) vs. doing following the process.  This is a blurred line that we still haven’t got right and by not getting it right it brings some confusion.
